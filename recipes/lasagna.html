Indulge in a mouthwatering experience with our hearty lasagna, featuring a perfect blend of flavors and textures. This meaty masterpiece combines sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef, sautéed with aromatic onions and garlic for an irresistible base. The rich tomato sauce, crafted from crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste, is subtly sweetened with two tablespoons of white sugar.

Embrace the comfort of lasagna noodles, whether store-bought or homemade, providing the ideal foundation for this culinary delight.

To elevate its decadence, a trio of cheeses takes center stage: Parmesan, mozzarella, and velvety ricotta. Bound together with the perfect consistency, an egg ensures that the ricotta holds its place within the layers, preventing any delightful ooze when you cut into this savory masterpiece.
